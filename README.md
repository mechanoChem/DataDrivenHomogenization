<B>Overview</B> <br>
=======================================================================
This repo contains code for generating the results reported in the reference, where we present a data-driven approach, which combines advanced neural network (NN) models with DNS to predict the homogenized, macroscopic, mechanical free energy and stress fields arising in a family of multi-component crystalline solids that develop microstructure. The microstructures are numerically generated by solving a coupled, mechanochemical spinodal decomposition problem governed by nonlinear strain gradient elasticity and the Cahn-Hilliard phase field equation, which is solved by the <a href="https://github.com/mechanoChem/mechanoChemIGA">mechanoChemIGA</a> code developed in the same group. A complexity of a hierarchical nature arises if the elastic free energy and its variation with strain is a small-scale fluctuation on the dominant trajectory of the total free energy driven by microstructural dynamics. The hierarchical structure of the free energy's evolution induces a multi-resolution character to the machine learning paradigm: We construct knowledge-based neural networks (KBNNs) with either pre-trained fully connected deep neural networks (DNNs), or pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that describe the dominant characteristic of the data to fully represent the hierarchically evolving free energy. We demonstrate multi-resolution learning of the materials physics; specifically of the nonlinear elastic response for both fixed and evolving microstructures.
